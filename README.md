# Krishi Unnati
Krishi Unnati is a mobile application for plant and crop disease detection using convolutional neural networks. This is our submission for CS391 Design Project course at IIIT Vadodara.

For a detailed report, please have a look at our [design project report](https://github.com/prateek-senapati/krishi-unnati/blob/main/CS391_Design_Project_Report_Krishi_Unnati.pdf).

You can find the Jupyter Notebook [here](https://github.com/prateek-senapati/krishi-unnati/blob/main/Krishi_Unnati.ipynb).

#### Note:

* The code for the mobile application development is yet to be uploaded in this repository. It will be done soon.
