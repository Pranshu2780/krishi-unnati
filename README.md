# Krishi Unnati
Krishi Unnati is a mobile application for plant and crop disease detection using convolutional neural networks. This is our submission for CS391 Design Project course at IIIT Vadodara.

* For a detailed report, please have a look at our **[design project report](https://github.com/prateek-senapati/krishi-unnati/blob/main/CS391_Design_Project_Report_Krishi_Unnati.pdf)**.

* You can find the Jupyter Notebook **[here](https://github.com/prateek-senapati/krishi-unnati/blob/main/Krishi_Unnati.ipynb)**.

* The mobile application for Krishi Unnati is in development process. Until the mobile application is ready, you can check out the Krishi Unnati [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) web app that has been built by [Prateek Senapati](https://github.com/prateek-senapati) **[here](https://github.com/prateek-senapati/krishi-unnati-streamlit)**. This has been built as a quick prototype for our project.

#### Note:

* The code for the mobile application development is yet to be uploaded in this repository. It will be done soon by the mobile application development team.

#### Update:

Here are some screenshots from the Krishi Unnati mobile application which is still under development:
