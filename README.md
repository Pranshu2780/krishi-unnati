# Krishi Unnati
Krishi Unnati is a mobile application for plant and crop disease detection using convolutional neural networks. We have used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to build and train a model which can classify crop and plant diseases from the images of their leaves. Our model has achieved a test accuracy of 86.57% by using transfer learning on a pre-trained VGG16 model.

* You can find the Jupyter Notebook **[here](https://github.com/prateek-senapati/krishi-unnati/blob/main/Krishi_Unnati.ipynb)**.

* The mobile application for Krishi Unnati is in development process. Until the mobile application is ready, you can check out the Krishi Unnati [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) web app that has been built by [Prateek Senapati](https://github.com/prateek-senapati) **[here](https://github.com/prateek-senapati/krishi-unnati-streamlit)**. This has been built as a quick prototype for our project.


#### Update:

Here are some screenshots of the Krishi Unnati mobile application which is still under development:
