# Krishi Unnati
Krishi Unnati is a mobile application for plant and crop disease detection using convolutional neural networks. We have used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to build and train a model which can classify crop and plant diseases from the images of their leaves. Our model has achieved a test accuracy of 96.61% by using transfer learning on a pre-trained VGG16 model.
